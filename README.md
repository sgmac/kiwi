# KiwiVM

Yet another not very useful CLI tool. Why not? It turns out I got a very cheap server long time ago, just 10USD per year, OpenVZ not very useful to be honest. 
I took a look to the API and decided to implement first a package to interact with the VPS. Now it's time for the tool.

This API doesn't have much sense, you need a VeID and PrivateKey for each VPS you have, that means you will need to use different clients when using the [API](https://github.com/sgmac/bandwagon).
